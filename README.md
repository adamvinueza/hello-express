# Teaching Technologies: a Dockerized Express App

A sample Dockerized Node/Express application, for educational purposes.

This is a version of the [webapp](https://github.com/adamvinueza/webapp)
project, updated to include a Dockerfile and a `yml` file for running
`docker-compose`. It also has a toy example of asynchronous handling and some
very simple function logging.
